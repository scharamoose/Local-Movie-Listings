How long did it take to complete the solution?
 - roughly 20 hours on and off.

What would you add if you had more time?
 - Make widget collapsible
 - Directions with option travel params (WALKING/PUBLIC TRANSPORT/ DRIVING)
 - Better responsiveness
 - Upcoming movie releases
 - List / card toggle

How would you deploy this to production?
 - In IIS, right click local computer => add website
 - Fill out the form, ensuring desired application pool, access and bindings populated
 - Start Website
 - Recycle Application Pool

How would you debug it in production?
 - I would use browser developer tools to inspect and debug code where possible.
 - If it were a server application, I would hope there was a production like environment in place where I could debug.

How would you know if it is failing at 2am?
 - There are a multitide of monitoring solutions available, so if any of the servers go down or even a portion of the network, 
   notifications can be configured to be sent to.
